# MorseMachine

Using the Pixy2 Camera, you can program different objects and colors to be recognized and use code to perform different types of actions. In this case, the camera was programmed to recognize LED lights. The amount of LED lights are detected and parsed as morse code using the following sequence:

1 LED detected = Dot

2 LEDs detected = Dash

3 LEDs detected = Space

A Space allows for blanks in the morse sequence where some of the character allowances out of the 4-5 dots/dashes are not used.

The underscore character allows for groups of characters to be broken up to become words
